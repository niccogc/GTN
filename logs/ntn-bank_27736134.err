[FATAL] CUDA out of memory - terminating job: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 16.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 39.49 GiB of which 512.00 KiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 39.49 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 38.02 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 960.88 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
